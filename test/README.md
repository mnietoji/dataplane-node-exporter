# openstack-network-exporter-test



## Introduction

Functional testcases for [openstack-network-exporter](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-network-exporter.git)

It will create a ovs-dpdk bridge together to openstack-network-exporter. Traffic
will be injected and statistics generated by openstack-network-exporter will be
checked 

## How to use it

Steps:
1. Configure the environment. Run the script
   [config_test_environment.sh](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-network-exporter-test/blob/main/test/config_test_environment.sh)

   ``` ./test/config_test_environment.sh ```

   It will configure an ovs bridge and 2 namespaces connected to the ovs bridge

2. Run testcases. Run the script
   [run_tests.sh](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-network-exporter-test/blob/main/test/run_tests.sh)

   ``` ./test/run_tests.sh ```

## Configuration files

Configuration files are used: [stats_conf.csv](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/openstack-network-exporter-test/blob/main/test/stats_conf.csv)

Contains a list of statistics to skip (due to some issues with those stats) or a
new threshold to compare values for those statistics if there is a huge
variability in their values
